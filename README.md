# Gradio (g r AA d oh) : Create an interactive app (UI) to share your ML/DL model with others.
Gradio is a versatile library that provides a simple way to create user interfaces for machine learning models.
* It supports various input types such as text, images, videos, and audio.
* You can deploy models for tasks like image classification, text generation, sentiment analysis, and more.
* It supports multiple input modalities. For example, you can create interfaces with both text and image inputs simultaneously.
* You can have multiple output components in the interface, making it suitable for tasks with multiple predictions or outputs.
* Gradio provides real-time updates as users interact with the interface. It's suitable for scenarios where you want to see model predictions dynamically.
* Gradio interfaces are highly customizable. You can specify the layout, styling, and other aspects to match your application's requirements.
* Gradio can be used with various machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, scikit-learn, and more.
* You can easily integrate pre-trained models from popular libraries into Gradio interfaces.
